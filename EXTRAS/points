*resource-saving apps to improve cities and keep citizens informed. Things like air quality, restaurant sanitation scores, building inspection scores and impending legislation should be readily available.

*Parking apps that show drivers where the nearest available parking spot it. These will save commuters time, gas, emissions and money, while also easing the flow of traffic.

*Apps that let users "adopt" city property â€” trash cans, call boxes, trees, fire hydrants, etc. â€” so the city doesn't have to spend money sending personnel to tend to them.

*High-tech waste management systems. Pay As You Throw (PAYT) garbage disposal would encourage people to recycle more and waste less, while using tools like RFID could improve sorting so recyclable plastic bottles don't end up in landfills.

*A city guide app, with information about museums, parks, landmarks, public art, restaurants and real-time traffic data.

*Wi-Fi in subway stations and on trains, along with weather information at every station.

*App or social media-based emergency alert and crisis response systems â€” every citizen should have access to vital information. Whether it's an alert about a crime that just happened or advice for a storm approaching the city.

*Police forces that use real-time data to monitor and prevent crime.

*OLED lights and surveillance in high-crime zones, like the 24/7 system coming to Kolkata

*Charging stations, like the solar-powered Strawberry Tree in Serbia. They also function as bus stops and Wi-Fi hot spots.

*Bike-sharing programs. And bike parking would be nice, too â€” maybe even underground and machine-driven, like the Eco Cycle in Japan.

*Smart climate control systems in homes and businesses, for example, the Nest thermostat.

*Widespread use of traffic rerouting apps, such as Greenway and Waze.

*Water-recycling systems, because while water covers 70% of the earth, we're not preserving the resource the way we should.

*Broadband Internet access for all citizens â€” maybe Google Fiber? â€” which will reduce the digital divide and spur economic growth.

*Mobile payments. Everywhere. For food, apparel and public transportation.

*Ride-sharing programs: Because it's a waste of money and gas to have two cars go the same place when neither is filled to capacity.
